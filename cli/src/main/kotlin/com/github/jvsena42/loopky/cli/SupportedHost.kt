/**
 * A shipped host as a *release asset*, which is the only part of the matrix the CLI owns (#210).
 *
 * Which hosts exist and why the other two do not is [DesktopNativeRow], in `:shared` beside the
 * libraries themselves — one table, because a second copy here would drift from the one the FFI
 * actually loads. What this adds is the download name, and it is the same table `cli/install.sh`
 * carries in shell: `loopky update` fetches by that name, so the two have to stay in step.
 *
 * The refusal happens at the CLI's command boundary rather than at the FFI, because this is where
 * a process can exit with something an agent can branch on. Without it an unshipped host is not
 * refused, it is *misdiagnosed*: `Native.load` throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError("… not found in
 * resource path …")`, `isNotFound()` matches those two words, and the answer is
 * [ExitCode.NotFound] — an agent is told the deck it asked for does not exist, on a machine where
 * no deck could ever be read.
